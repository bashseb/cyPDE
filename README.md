Very basic Isogeometric Analysis implementation in python/cython. 

In order to learn about Isogeometric Analysis, Finite Element Analysis and NURBS, I rewrote a simplified version of geoPDEs (on sourceforge) using python as an exercise.
The goal was to get it running quickly and not thinking too much about designing it in a pythonic way (it's not). If I'd do it again, it'd be completely different. 

I'd like to express my gratitude to C. de Falco, A. Reali and R. Vazquezc for providing GeoPDEs.
